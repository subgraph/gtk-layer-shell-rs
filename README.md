# Rust bindings for gtk-layer-shell

This repository provides Rust bindings for the https://github.com/wmww/gtk-layer-shell
library. To use these bindings, it is assumed that you have built and installed
`gtk-layer-shell` and its dependencies.

Note: there are other bindings out there that may be more actively maintained. This
version is mostly for internal use. It is updated once and awhile as needed but
other versions may work better for you.

## Usage

Examples can be found in the `examples/` directory. To run an example:

```bash
$ cargo run --example example
```

## Regenerating bindings

Sometimes the `.gir` file for gtk-layer-shell will need to be updated with
new versions, API changes, etc. The bindings will need to be regenerated when
the new file is added.

To regenerate the bindings:

```bash
$ make gir
```

Afterwards, ensure that building and running the examples still works.
